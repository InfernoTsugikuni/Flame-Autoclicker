SET VENV=myenv

IF NOT EXIST %VENV% (
    python -m venv %VENV%
)

Save this as a .bat file and run it. This is only for using the .py file if your AntiVirus detects the prebuilt binary as malware because of it being compiled using PyInstaller. For compiling the autoclicker.c file use this command:

```bash
gcc autoclicker.c -o autoclicker.exe
```
